Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
===========

The application for Hacker School asks for you to provide an example of a
program you've created, and suggests a simple Tic Tac Toe game. I remember 
reading about a game that uses Tic Tac Toe rules, in which instead of playing
on a single Tic Tac Toe board you play Tic Tac Toe on a board composed of
individual Tic Tac Toe boards. The rules of the game, called Ultimate
Tic Tac Toe are described

I thought it would be fun to try coding the game.  It's written in Python
and played through the command line, as games were played in days of yore.
